          The Department for Education publishes yearly <a href="https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/download-data">school performance data</a>, which apart from overall performance also includes <strong>subject-specific</strong> performance for A-levels. This website tries to expose and allow comparison by this data, which wasn't shown by most of the school comparison websites at the time.
